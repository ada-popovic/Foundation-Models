    <h1>I. Sudowrite</h1>

    I woke up very early in the morning. As always, the only thing I could hear was the wildly uninteresting sounds of the forest. It was the same damned forest, day after day. It was starting to kill me. I had been on the run since I was a teenager and the only thing that had changed was the scenery.
    </br>
    </br>
    I waited for an hour to make sure that the forest was still empty, then I finally got up and got ready to go fishing. The phone call with Alexei had woken me up. I had been planning to make a move right then, but he had other plans.

“I have to wait until my friends have found you a safe house. It is the only thing that is keeping me alive.” He had said.

I knew that I couldn’t trust him, but the thought of taking care of a baby was overwhelming. The baby and the mother.

How did I end up with this in my life? I had been hiding from the world for years and now I couldn’t seem to walk away.

    <h1>II. InferKit</h1>

    “I know the feeling,” she said. “This was the deal I made with my daughter when she was nine.”

“You know what my deal was?”

“Well, you disappeared for almost a year before you came home.”

“I do, but I didn’t think that I would be back in this position so soon. I didn’t mean for this to happen to you.”
</br>
</br>

I was thinking about how I used to have a clue, back when I was living it up in the clubs. I had had my fun. I was never mean to anyone, but I wasn’t looking for a relationship. I was looking for a good time. I had my life all figured out. I was on top of the world, and then my life came crashing down around me.
</br>
</br>

I had been in a relationship for about two years when I met someone new. We started seeing each other, and it was great. We would go out to the clubs and dance all night. We would drink and party, and we would always end up back at my place. We would have amazing sex, and then we would fall asleep in each other’s arms.
</br>
</br>

It was perfect, or so I thought.
